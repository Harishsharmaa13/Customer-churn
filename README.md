## Machine Learning (ML) Part  
- **Churn Prediction** – ML models estimate customer attrition.  
- **Feature Importance Analysis** – Identifies key factors affecting churn.  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, encoding, and scaling to improve accuracy.  
---
## Power BI Part  
- **Interactive Dashboard** – Visualizes churn trends and patterns.  
- **Customer Segmentation** – Groups customers based on demographics.  
- **Numerical to Categorical Transformation** – Enhances data interpretability.  
---
## Tech Stack  
- **Python** – Data processing & ML model development  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & reporting  
---
## Usage  
### ML Workflow  
1. **Preprocess** the data using the notebook.  
2. **Train and evaluate** the ML model.  
3. **Generate churn probability scores** for customers.  

### Power BI Workflow  
1. **Import processed data & predictions** into Power BI.  
2. **Analyze insights & trends** using the dashboard.  
3. **Apply filters & segmentation** for better understanding.  
---
## Future Enhancements  
- Enhance **feature engineering** for better accuracy.  
- Deploy a **real-time churn prediction system**.  
- Expand **Power BI visualizations** for deeper insights.
